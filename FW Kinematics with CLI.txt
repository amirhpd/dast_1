FW kinematics:

ros2 launch description display.launch.py

ros2 topic list 
gives: /tf which is dynamic transformation and /tf_static which is static transformation

ros2 topic info /tf --verbose
we see that robot_state_publisher node is publishing to /tf

ros2 topic eccho /tf
it constantly publishes the msgs that define the position of each frame relative to the previous frame

ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
generates a graph of the frames and their connections

ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo world gripper_link
gives translation and rotation values of between the given frames
if the first and last frames are passed, it actually solves the fw kinematics problem
