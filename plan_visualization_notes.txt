Plan visualization did not work.
interface_pose.cpp code modified to show the plan.
Different approaches are tried out. eg. visual_tools
One obstacle was to make the getCurrentState work. It finally worked by adding "use_sim_time": True to all nodes in launch files, 
and adding the code to spin once to the interface file.
The /display_planned_path topic gets values, but still nothing is visible in rviz.
